# Installation

If you've read the [Sunbird architecture](/architecture) description, you will have read that it requires several distributed components for runtime operation. Getting started with this complexity can be a daunting challenge. Fortunately, we've simplified the installation process for some common scenarios.

### Choosing an installation method
Based on your usage and the level of complexity which you are comfortable with, there are a few different paths to installing and running Sunbird.

#### I want to try Sunbird out
If you are looking to experiment with Sunbird and test out its feature set, we recommend you use the [Sunbird sandbox](https://staging.open-sunbird.org/) which is already running in the cloud. Note, any data created in the sandbox will be erased after 24 hours.

#### I want to contribute code
If you plan to modify and contribute code to the Sunbird project, we recommend you follow the developer installation process. This will get you started quickly so you can start submitting code.

#### I want 10-10,000 users to use Sunbird
If you plan to run Sunbird in a setting of 10-10000 users, we recommend you follow the small/medium deployment process. This option uses less resources to run Sunbird and has some limits on how much the installed application can scale.

#### I want the works!
If you plan to run Sunbird in a setting with 10,000+ users, we recommend you follow the large-scale deployment process. This will deploy Sunbird to a cloud-hosting provider of your choice in a fully containerised manner. The containers allow you to scale the resources Sunbird consumes based on the usage.

## Prerequisites
Each of the installation options requires a few pre-requisites to be satisfied. At a minimum, you should be
* using a Linux OS flavour (developer installation is possible on MacOS)
* comfortable with a terminal  -- Sunbird install is triggered from the command-line terminal
