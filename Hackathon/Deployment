## Deployment Architecture

### Infrastructure
Sunbird can run on Virtual Machines (VMs) on various Cloud providers or bare metal. Cloud Infrastructure automation is work in progress.

### Stable Builds Registry
Sunbird builds are available at a [Image Registry](https://hub.docker.com/u/sunbird/dashboard/). These builds are in the form of a [Dockerfile](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/). Stable releases are tagged as ```gold```. Deployment scripts pull the ```gold``` images for production deployment. The ```gold``` images are also versioned to allow for release management and upgrade paths.

### Software Runtime
Most runtimes in Sunbird are containerized as [Docker containers](https://www.docker.com/what-container) for portability, process isolation and standardization.  
For container orchestration, this repo contains scripts to run Sunbird on [Docker Swarm](https://docs.docker.com/engine/swarm/). Cloud providers provide container services. In this repo, we are using [ACS-Engine](https://github.com/Azure/acs-engine).

### Logging, Monitoring and Operational dashboards
Sunbird comes with log aggregation and metrics reporting out of the box. For log aggregation, Sunbird is using a combination of [cAdvisor](https://github.com/google/cadvisor), [ELK stack](https://www.elastic.co/webinars/introduction-elk-stack), [Prometheus](https://prometheus.io/) and their plugin ecosystem.
Ops dashboards are built using [Grafana](https://grafana.com/) with some [reference](https://github.com/project-sunbird/sunbird-devops/tree/master/cloud/monitoring/grafana) dashboards.

### Custom builds
Sunbird is extendible. Sunbird can be taken as a base image with custom implementation of public interfaces and rebuilt for deployment. Scripts are available for ramping up of complex deployments with support to run local build promotions and deployments.
