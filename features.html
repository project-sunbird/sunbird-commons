					<h1>Features</h1>
					<p>There are various sources of information, internet being the primary fore-runner. It thus becomes imperative that our platform provides state-of the art features to enable innovative and engaging learning experience.
Keeping in mind this need, our features include:</p>
					<p><strong>Societal Platform Architecture</strong></p>
					<p>Sunbird allows one or more organizations and communities to exist as tier-1 entities on the platform. Each organization can independently manage their users, training and learning processes and user communities.</p>
					<p><strong>User and organization registry and profiles</strong></p>
					<p>Sunbird allows organizations to store verified information about users and organizations and use this repository as a verified registry to enable other user actions and functions. </p>
					<p><strong>Courses, Trainings and Lesson Plans</strong></p>
					<p>Sunbird provides features that allow for hosting of open and closed courses. Courses can be setup with one or more batches that can be hosted on different dates/times. Sunbird also allows authoring of lesson plans for courses and textbooks via provision of intuitive templates and workflows.</p>
					<p><strong>Open Content Resource Library</strong></p>
					<p>Content created or uploaded on a Sunbird instance is published under a Creative Commons License and therefore is truly free to consume. In addition, each organization on Sunbird can define their own curation and review workflows to ensure that published content is of high quality.</p>
					<p><strong>Communities of Practice, Collaboration and Messaging</strong></p>
					<p>Sunbird offers collaboration and messaging features such as course discussions, configurable communities of practice as well as activity feeds for users generated from communities and courses that users are engaged with.</p>
					<p><strong>Data and Dashboards</strong></p>
					<p>All interactions with the user interface and content are available as data and can be used to analyse user interactions with courses, content and the platform.</p>
					<p><strong>Badges for Certifications</strong></p>
					<p>Badges communicate skills and achievements by providing visual symbols of accomplishments packed with verifiable data and evidence that can be shared across the web. They empower individuals to take their learning with them, wherever they go, building a rich picture of their lifelong learning journey.</p>
					<p><strong>Curation</strong></p>
					<p>Within content platforms, the demand for curation has grown out of the increasing need to help users find quality, coherent, and relevant content on specific topics without having to spend great amounts of time and energies to search, browse and scan multiple different sources.</p>
					<p><strong>Card and Feed-based User Interface optimized for Mobile Access</strong></p>
					<p>To ensure optimal usability, the platform uses cards and feeds extensively for organization of information. Card-based design supports limited working memory by allowing users to break up information through the process of chunking and allowing focus on a single task or piece of information at a time.</p>
