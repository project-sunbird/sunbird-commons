Taxonomy    |A pre-determined classification that provides an unambiguous conceptual framework. The classification describes and separates mutually exclusive categories and subcategories of topics. Taxonomies help individuals and search engines find and retrieve information and content  |  On the NTP, all content pieces must have metadata such as a title, description and other identifying elements that classify and aid the flow of content.

It also helps the system automatically recommend content based on user profile and preference, thus enhancing user experience
Metadata    |Information about data (content piece) that further qualifies and describes the it. This information is not part of the content body, but is stored in the backend.

Searchability   |The ability of a human, system or computer to explore or examine, to find information  |When users type in keywords to search on the platform, the NTP search engine gets the most relevant and appropriate results in the fastest time
Discoverability |The ability of a human, system or computer to find out or unearth that which was previously unknown    |The NTP has a unique search algorithm that uses its pre-defined taxonomy to show content that is associated with the keywords specified
content |Expression and elucidation of a thought using speech, writing, images, or any other art    |On the NTP, content can be standalone or a compilation of study material units. The study material can be in video, audio, text or multimedia format. It can be created or uploaded on the platform. All content must have a learning outcome
