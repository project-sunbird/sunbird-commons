# Installation

If you've read the Sunbird architecture description, you will be aware that it requires several distributed components for runtime operation.
<P>This is web-based system,which means there there is no executable file (aka no .exe files), and it must  run on a web server and accessed through a web browser. Getting started with this complexity can be cumbersome. Fortunately,we've simplified the installation process for some common scenarios.

## Choosing an installation method
Based on your usage and the level of complexity which you are comfortable with, there are a few different options for installing and running Sunbird.

### Pre-requisites
Each of the installation option requires a few pre-requisites to be satisfied. 
At a minimum, you should be:
* Using a Linux OS flavour (developer installation is possible on MacOS).
* Comfortable with a terminal.Sunbird installation is triggered from the command-line terminal.

Note: pre-requisites are not required to try out the sandbox option.
