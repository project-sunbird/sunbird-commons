## Installation Overview

Note: pre-requisites are not required to try out the sandbox option.

*  **I want to try Sunbird**
	If you are looking to experiment with Sunbird and test out its feature set, we recommend you use the [Sunbird sandbox](https://staging.open-sunbird.org/) which is already running in the cloud. Note, any data created in the sandbox will be erased after 24 hours.
*  **I want to extend Sunbird**
	If you plan to modify and contribute code to the Sunbird project, we recommend you follow the process [Developer installation]
	(/developer-docs/developer_install)
	This will get you started quickly so you can start extending Sunbird.
