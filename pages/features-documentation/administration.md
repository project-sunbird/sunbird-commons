## Administration

Being open source, it is imperative to have checks and balances to maintain the integrity and quality of the solution.  Availability and access to Sunbirdâ€™s code, functionality, features and content depend on user rights and privileges. User responsibilities determine their rights to create, review, publish or consume content. Privileged users have rights to manage user or organization access, profiles, on-boarding, removal, passwords and site look-and-feel customization.
