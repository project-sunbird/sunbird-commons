1. Write an email to content.ntp@centralsquarefoundation.org, with the subject as ‘Request for custom home page

2. The team will respond with recommendations and a checklist

3. Create your own static design in  html

4. Send the html page to content.ntp@centralsquarefoundation.org 

5. The team will create and  integrate it within the portal

6. After it is integrated, the team will share the unique url with the organizatio

7. Typically, the url for the organization’s home page will be https://ntp.net.in/*contentprovider* 

**Note:**
Home page serves as the entry point for any website.
