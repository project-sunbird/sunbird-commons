The platform has set protocols for user roles and functionalities. The user base follows a certain hierarchy, where the administrators provide rights and permissions to other users, based on need, to accomplish their tasks across the platform. 

Strategically, every state should have designated system administrators, who create and assign rights to organizational administrators, who in turn create and assign content creator, reviewer or general user permissions.  

Content creators use the in-built content authoring tool to create new lessons, courses, etc. on the portal.

The process to get content creation rights is depicted in the following conceptual diagram:
