Education caters to the beauty of diversity. Each learner has a different style, pace and purpose of learning, though the outcome is more or less aligned . Frameworks cater to these diverse needs.
For example; a topic like longitude could be taught as part of Geography in one framework, but as part of Adventure in another framework.
