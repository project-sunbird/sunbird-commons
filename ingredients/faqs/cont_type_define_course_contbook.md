The difference between a Course, Content and Book are undelined below:  

- **Content** is a complete learning unit that can be used by any user. Content can be of several types, for example; course, textbook, lesson, worksheet, etc.

- **Course** is content provided in sequence, broken down in modules, open for enrolment and completion for a duration. You can attach prerequisites for a course, and it may contain assessments.

- **Book** is a collection of content units. It can be compiled or curated from school textbooks that conform to syllabi of state or central boards, for a grade, in the said medium of instruction and language. Text books may also be compiled separately without adhering to any syllabus, but forming a logical unit of content pieces for the given subject matter.
