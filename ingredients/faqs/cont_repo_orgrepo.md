The platform has only one common repository for all organizations.

If the organization maintains a separate repository, the content in that repository does not automatically reflect in the platform's repository. Any updates made to content in the organization's repository must be re-uploaded on the platform's site. The uploaded content undergoes the review process, before it is re-published on the platform.

Content that is already submitted to the platform repository can be modified using platform's in-built content editor. To make changes or modify uploaded content:

1. Click Edit on the content to be modified
1. Modify the content
1. Save the changes
1. Send the artefact for review
1. The artefact will be published after review
