## Managing search results

To keep a page from showing up in search results:

1. Set `exclude_from_google_search` (above) to `true`, to block external search engines.
1. Add the filename of the page (omitting `.md`) to `js/search/excluded_files.json`, to block the internal search engine.

#### Important Notes
- Exclusion matching is currently imperfect: excluding a filename of `foo` will also exclude `foo-bar`.
- Pages will still be accessible by direct URL, and search engines may not respect the `noindex` setting. All content published should be considered as public.

## Best practices

- Never edit anything inside the `_site` directory. These are all generated files and are **always** overwritten.
- Ask before editing files elsewhere unless you're extremely confident that you know what you're doing.
- Use level two headers (H2) to structure content. For example, major steps in the Guide, or individual topics in Advanced and Support.
- Use numbered lists for smaller steps within the major steps if there are more than one.
- Use level five headers (H5) for FAQ questions. It looks just like bold text, but it helps with SEO.
- In general, use whatever heading level is next in line. If you get past H4, ask yourself probing questions.
- Keep page sections (`overview`, `guide`, `advanced`, `support`) contiguous for sanity, even though the conditional syntax doesnâ€™t require it.
- Deep Link is **always two words**, in every form (noun, verb, adjective)
