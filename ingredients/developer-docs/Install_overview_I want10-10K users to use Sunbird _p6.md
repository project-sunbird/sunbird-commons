### I want 10-10K users to use Sunbird (Medium Scale)
-->

If you plan to run Sunbird in a setting of 10-10000 users, we recommend you follow the [small/medium deployment](https://github.com/project-sunbird/sunbird-commons/blob/master/Hackathon/Installation_S.md) process. This option uses less resources to run Sunbird and has some limits on how much the installed application can scale.
