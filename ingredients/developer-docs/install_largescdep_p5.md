###  **I want a large scale deployment of Sunbird**
If you plan to run Sunbird in a setting with 10k+ users, we recommend you follow the [large-scale deployment](/install/large-scale-cloud) process 

{% ingredient /developer-docs/install_largescdepcontent_p8 %}{% endingredient %}. 

This will deploy Sunbird to a cloud-hosting provider of your choice in a fully containerised manner. The containers allow you to scale the resources Sunbird consumes based on the usage.
