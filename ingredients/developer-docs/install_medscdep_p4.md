### **I want a medium scale deployment of Sunird**
If you plan to run Sunbird in a setting upto 10k users, we recommend you follow the process [Medium scale deployment] 

{% ingredient /developer-docs/install_medscdepcontent_p7 %}{% endingredient %}. 

This option uses less resources to run Sunbird and has some limits on how much the installed application can scale.
