### **I want a medium scale deployment of Sunird**
If you plan to run Sunbird in a setting upto 10k users, we recommend you follow the [Medium scale deployment](install_medscdepcontnet.md) process. This option uses less resources to run Sunbird and has some limits on how much the installed application can scale.
