If you've read the Sunbird architecture description, you will be aware that it requires several distributed components for runtime operation. This is web-based system,which means there there is no executable file (aka no .exe files), and it must  run on a web server and accessed through a web browser. Getting started with this complexity can be cumbersome. Fortunately,we've simplified the installation process for some common scenarios.

**Choosing an installation method**

Based on your usage and the level of complexity which you are comfortable with, there are a few different options for installing and running Sunbird.

**Pre-requisites**

Each of the installation option requires a few pre-requisites to be satisfied. 
At a minimum, you should be:

+ Using a Linux OS flavour (developer installation is possible on MacOS).
+ Comfortable with a terminal. Sunbird installation is triggered from the command-line terminal.

***Note: pre-requisites are not required to try out the sandbox option***
