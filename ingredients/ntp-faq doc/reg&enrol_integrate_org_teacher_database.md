DIKSHA allows you to integrate the organization’s existing teacher list with DIKSHA’s teacher registry. DIKSHA’s teacher registry is a consolidated list of all teachers within its registered organizations. This consolidated database will help spread of learning and education, nationwide, through structured programs.
To set up the teacher registry:
Collate a list of existing users into a database
Write an email  to content.ntp@centralsquarefoundation.org, with the subject as Setting up Teacher Registry
The team will respond with an information checklist.
Ensure that you have all the requirements on the checklist. The checklist includes information such as:
Unique and permanent:
i.Organization ID
ii.Username for teacher
iii.Teacher ID
Verified Email ID and mobile number of the teacher
Defined role of the user (Whether the user is creator, member, admin, reviewer)
Reply to the team’s  email at  content.ntp@centralsquarefoundation.org  informing them  that you have met all the requirements on the checklist
The team will share a document with a link to the github repository to  your organization’s registered email ID.
The github repository will contain six APIs.
Install the APIs and run the code from  the repository, on the organization’s server
After installation, the organization’s administrator should generate a private and public key
The organization’s administrator should send an email with the public key  to content.ntp@centralsquarefoundation.org  
The organization’s administrator should install the private key and run the data on the organization’s server.
Simultaneously this data is integrated on DIKSHA to  complete the teacher registry on DIKSHA
The organization’s administrator assigns rights and permissions to each registered user
